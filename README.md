Prompt Warrior is an agent skill that reads your local session logs — Claude Code out
of the box; Codex CLI, OpenCode, Gemini CLI and Copilot via documented log formats — and
turns them into something between a psychological profile and an RPG character sheet: real numbers
on a fixed scale, a title you didn't choose but absolutely deserve, and achievements
you've been grinding for months without knowing it. Runs 100% locally on stdlib Python —
nothing ever leaves your machine.

## Why bother?

- **You love achievements, damn it.** 74 of them, common to legendary, Steam-style cards
  with rarity colors and hover-to-reveal unlock conditions. You already earned some of
  them — you just haven't been told yet.
- **You'll finally learn who you are.** Not "a developer" — a *Furious Terminal
  Commander, level 90, "The Iron Fist"*. Class comes from your harness, race from your
  favorite model: a Claude Code Warrior riding a Mighty Opus.
- **The AI writes your chronicle.** A short grimoire-flavored biography composed from
  your actual behavior. It's weirdly accurate and slightly uncomfortable. In a good way.
- **Numbers nobody else will show you.** Your werewolf index (night profanity vs day),
  session boiling point (how many messages until the first flare-up), double-texting
  rate, subagent armies spawned, the exact hour you are most dangerous.
- **A fixed scale means bragging rights.** Formulas are frozen ([SCALE](references/scale.md)).
  Same math for everyone — swap cards with a friend and settle who's the real Tyrant.
- **It roasts you with receipts.** Strengths and weaknesses derived strictly from your
  own metrics, every advice backed by a cited study — debunked prompting myths listed
  too ([sources.md](references/sources.md)).
- **Your monster evolves.** A deterministic creature is assembled offline from your
  title (optional `robohash` package, zero network) — change your ways, change your
  monster.
- **100% local and private.** stdlib-only Python, zero dependencies, no API keys, no
  network calls. Your logs, your machine — your shame stays yours.

## A taste of the achievements

| Achievement | Rarity | Unlock |
|---|---|---|
| **Tyrant** | 🟡 legendary | negativity outnumbers praise 10:1 |
| **Gutenberg** | 🟡 legendary | 25M+ tokens generated |
| **Werewolf** | 🟣 epic | night profanity ≥ 1.5× the daytime dose |
| **Short Fuse** | 🟣 epic | first flare-up by message three of a session |
| **Night's Watch** | 🔵 rare | 30%+ of activity between midnight and 6 a.m. |
| **Cowboy** | ⚪ common | zero plan modes across 50+ sessions |

…and 68 more, from *Sprinter* to *Lord of Legions*. Conditions are honest, thresholds
are frozen, nobody gets one for free.

## What's on the card

- **Title & identity** — epithet + rank + level, class and race, monster avatar
- **Warrior's Chronicle** — the LLM-written mini-biography
- **Message volume, top imperatives, tone markers** — how you actually talk
- **Hours & days of week** — when you actually work
- **Six gauges** — Rage, Warmth, Rigor, Nocturnality, Impatience, Cache Thrift
- **Economy & arsenal** — tokens burned (deduplicated like ccusage), cache efficiency,
  tool roles (Operator / Surgeon / Archaeologist / Puppeteer), MCP fleet, file
  extensions you actually touch, most expensive sessions
- **Battle habits** — 12 deep-cut signals from interruptions to RU/EN code-switching
- **Signature vocabulary** — the words that are unmistakably yours
- **Strong & weak** — with a fix and a source for every weakness
- **Progress between visits** — come back in a week: new achievements, level-ups,
  metric shifts. That's the share-worthy moment.

Everything ships in both **RU and EN**, symmetrically — the card speaks your language.
Cross-harness aware: session-log formats for Codex CLI, OpenCode, Gemini CLI and Copilot
are documented in [references/harnesses.md](references/harnesses.md).

## The inline widget

The same card renders as a live widget right in the chat — with an "Open HTML card"
button, hover unlock conditions and the achievements accordion:

## Quick Start

**The lazy way — one message.** Paste this into Claude Code and it installs and runs
everything by itself:

```text
Install the Prompt Warrior skill and run it end to end.

Install: git clone https://github.com/timoncool/prompt-warrior into YOUR OWN
skills directory, named prompt-warrior (for Claude Code that is
~/.claude/skills/; other harnesses — wherever your skills live).

Then follow the installed skill's SKILL.md as a regular user: all-time profile,
HTML card + open it in the browser, inline widget, profile breakdown and
recommendations. Don't invent anything beyond the skill.
```

**Or step by step:**

1. **Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/timoncool/prompt-warrior ~/.claude/skills/prompt-warrior
   ```
   Windows (PowerShell):
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/timoncool/prompt-warrior "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\skills\prompt-warrior"
   ```
   or install as a plugin:
   ```
   /plugin marketplace add timoncool/prompt-warrior
   /plugin install prompt-warrior@prompt-warrior
   ```

2. **Ask Claude Code**
   ```
   /prompt-warrior
   ```
   or just say: *"build my prompt warrior profile"*.

3. **Get your card** — an inline widget plus a self-contained `ai-profile.html` you can
   open, screenshot and share.

## Usage

- *"build my prompt warrior profile"* — all-time profile
- *"my prompt profile for the last week"* — last 7 days
- *"профиль за июнь"* — exact date range
- *"profile for project X"* — a single project (`--project`)
- The period is always your choice; the skill never picks one silently.
- No browser, no widget? The card falls back to plain text right in the console.

Under the hood: `scripts/analyze.py` reads `~/.claude/projects` JSONL logs (read-only),
deduplicates your messages, computes metrics and writes `profile.json`; Claude authors
only the chronicle and the strengths/weaknesses picks (`content.json`), and
`scripts/render.py` builds the whole card from them — the model never hand-writes
HTML or reads SVG.
